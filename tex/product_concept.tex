This section contains a general description of the project: an underwater robot for the 2022 IEEE Student robotics competition. Therefore, the intended audiences will be the judges for this competition. 

\subsection{Purpose and Use}
The purpose of the underwater robot is to collect tennis balls from bodies of water and disposing them in a container, simulating collecting trash and debris from oceans and lakes. The robot will traverse through difficult obstacles, becoming a challenge for the competitors. 

\subsection{Intended Audience}
The intended audience are the judges. They will give and take away points based on the rules of the competition. Generally speaking, they will be judging how well it can function as a tool for cleaning up the oceans. If the underwater robot were to be made available publicly or commercially, waste companies would be its main customers. It would be useful in cleaning up the ocean whenever there's an oil spillage or anything else that could harm it.
