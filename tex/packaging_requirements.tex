The packaging requirement for this project is very minimal since we are not delivering it to a customer and rather displaying the project to a panel of judges. Upon finishing the project, the product will be a cuboid shaped robot made with carbon fiber pipes as a frame and hardware systems installed on the frame and carefully stowed in a pelican case to avoid any damage caused by water when the robot undertakes its task underwater. The final product will also have thrusters mounted on the frame that will be clearly visible propelling water during underwater movements. The final product will lastly have a remote control that will be used to operate the robot underwater.

\subsubsection{Description}
The packaging our product will be minimal since it is not being delivered to a customer but being displayed to a panel by the team itself. The entire assembled robot frame will be packed in a box with Styrofoam all around the robot to prevent any damage in transportation. The remote control will be stored in a separate box with the needed wires and tether that the robot will be controlled with.
