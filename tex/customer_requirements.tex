The IEEE competition ruleset specifies the requirements for this project. In addition there are some requirements that are implied given the fact that it is a competition. The following will specify the requirements that have come to be understood via a detailed reading of the ruleset to the competition, and dialogue with the competition judges on clarification of the rules. 

\subsection{Size Requirement}
\subsubsection{Description}
Robot must fit inside a 20x20x20 and be less than 30 pounds. Additionally there are tiers of bonus points for lighter robots, 24-28 pounds, 20-23.99 pounds, 15-19.99 pounds and less than 15 pounds. All bonus point weight requirements are low priority at this time.

IEEE 2022 R5 Competition Rules
\subsubsection{Constraints}
There is only a maximum weight requirement, no minimum weight requirement. Given our time constraints it is unlikely that we will meet the low priority bonus point requirements.
\subsubsection{Standards}
Not Applicable
\subsubsection{Priority}
30 pound threshold Critical priority, all bonus point weight thresholds Low priority

\subsection{Movement}
\subsubsection{Description}
The robot will need to be able to move submerged in water forwards, backwards and need the ability to turn from side to side. It will need to be able to locate itself in any point within a continuous pool of water. It will also need to be able to maintain buoyancy and hover at a constant depth for indefinite amounts of time.

IEEE 2022 R5 Competition Rules
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Our robot is tethered, so movement is restricted by the constant attachment to the tether.
\subsubsection{Standards}
Not Applicable
\subsubsection{Priority}
Critical

\subsection{Debris Transportation}
\subsubsection{Description}
A block of trash will need to be grasped and transported to another location. The robot will be able to navigate while grasping the debris block, navigate through obstacles while holding the block and then accurately place the block on a platform.

\subsection{Button Pushing}
\subsubsection{Description}
The robot will be able to push a button for the purposes of opening a hinged lid.

\subsection{Floating Debris Collection}
\subsubsection{Description}
The robot will be able to collect debris that floats that is the size of a tennis ball. It will be able to store the tennis balls in some fashion on the robot mechanism itself and then navigate with the tennis balls through the pool.
\subsubsection{Source}
IEEE 2022 R5 Competition Rules
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The tennis balls should not negatively effect the robots ability to navigate.

\subsection{Floating Debris Deposit}
\subsubsection{Description}
The robot will be able to deposit a total of 10 pieces of floating tennis ball into the floating debris deposit box. The storage system will either be able to hold 10 total tennis balls or be reloadable so that multiple trips could collect all the debris.
